# Decision based medical consultation system
The decision system accepts the symptoms of an unhealthy patient and then predicts the disease of the patient and suggests a possible remedy. Currently the inference engine and knowledge base of the system is limited to only certain diseases, as the goal was to understand how an expert system is developed using SWI-Prolog. In future the plan is to expand them and make it more diverse.

How to run:-

1. In the SWI-Prolog GUI click on consult and select the file name which has the inference engine and knowledge base and make sure the extension is pl.

2. Once it compiles successfully then copy paste the part of code which is present under "amr :-"

3. Make sure you are well versed about the syntax of SWI-Prolog while answering.
